# Run PiHole on your UDM

## Features

1. Run PiHole on your UDM with a completely isolated network stack.  This will not port conflict or be influenced by any changes on by Ubiquiti
2. Persists through reboots and firmware updates.

## Requirements

1. You have successfully setup the on boot script described [here](https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities/tree/master/on-boot-script)

## Customization

* Feel free to change [20-dns.conflist](../cni-plugins/20-dns.conflist) to change the IP address of the container.
* Update [10-dns.sh](../dns-common/on_boot.d/10-dns.sh) with your own values
* If you want IPv6 support use [20-dnsipv6.conflist](../cni-plugins/20-dnsipv6.conflist) and update [10-dns.sh](../dns-common/on_boot.d/10-dns.sh) with the IPv6 addresses. Also, please provide IPv6 servers to podman using --dns arguments.

## Steps

1. On your controller, make a Corporate network with no DHCP server and give it a VLAN. For this example we are using VLAN 5.
2. Copy [20-dns.conflist](../cni-plugins/20-dns.conflist) to /mnt/data/podman/cni.  This will create your podman macvlan network
3. Copy [10-dns.sh](../dns-common/on_boot.d/10-dns.sh) to /mnt/data/on_boot.d and update its values to reflect your environment
4. Execute /mnt/data/on_boot.d/10-dns.sh
5. Run the pihole docker container, be sure to make the directories for your persistent pihole configuration.  They are mounted as volumes in the command below.

    ```sh
     podman run -d --network dns --restart always \
        --name pihole \
        -e TZ="America/Los Angeles" \
        -v "/mnt/data/etc-pihole/:/etc/pihole/" \
        -v "/mnt/data/pihole/etc-dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/" \
        --dns=127.0.0.1 --dns=1.1.1.1 \
        --hostname pi.hole \
        -e VIRTUAL_HOST="pi.hole" \
        -e PROXY_LOCATION="pi.hole" \
        -e ServerIP="10.0.5.3" \
        -e IPv6="False" \
        pihole/pihole:latest
    ```

    The below errors are expected and acceptable

    ```sh
    ERRO[0022] unable to get systemd connection to add healthchecks: dial unix /run/systemd/private: connect: no such file or directory
    ERRO[0022] unable to get systemd connection to start healthchecks: dial unix /run/systemd/private: connect: no such file or directory
    ```

6. Set pihole password

    ```sh
    podman exec -it pihole pihole -a -p YOURNEWPASSHERE
    ```

7. Update your DNS Servers to 10.0.5.3 (or your custom ip) in all your DHCP configs.
8. Access the pihole like you would normally.
